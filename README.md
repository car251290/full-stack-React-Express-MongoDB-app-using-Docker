full stack React/Express/MongoDB app using Docker

## Why should you care about Docker?
Docker is simply one of the most important technologies at the moment. It lets you run apps inside containers that are mostly isolated from “everything”.

Each container is like an individual virtual machine stripped out of everything that is not needed to run your app. This makes containers very light, fast and secure.
